# llm_growing_agent
 This is a project aimed at creating an agent that perpetually thinks and develops itself. It can add entries into an SQLite database and change the structure of that databaase. It also has the ability to search the web when it needs to. It utilizes OpenAI function calling and the responses API. All that is needed to run it is an OpenAI API key.
