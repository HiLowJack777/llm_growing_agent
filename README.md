# LLM Growing Agent — A Self-Evolving AI

This project is a **self-reflective AI agent** that thinks, stores its thoughts, evolves its own memory schema, and is interactable in a simple desktop GUI.

It’s designed to be a complete thinking agent with journaling, reflection prompts, SQL schema evolution, and web search capabilities.

## Features
- Autonomous journaling and reflection
- Self-evolving memory using SQLite
- Schema awareness and auto-migration
- Short-term memory buffer
- Reflection prompt scoring and strategy evaluation
- Web search integration using OpenAI `responses` API
- Simple Tkinter-based GUI interface
- Semantic search over stored data (e.g., "What thoughts did I record today?")
